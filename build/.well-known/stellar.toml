desc="Buying a diamond does not have to be a stressful experience. Every diamond is unique and there are a variety of factors which affect the price of a diamond. Focus on those factors most important to you, and choose a diamond that satisfies your individual standards for beauty
You’ll often hear the term ‘white’ applied to colourless diamonds. This is not technically true to name diamonds colourless – as white on the colour spectrum is the sum of all colours, and upon gazing at the face of a white diamond, you will see hints and hues of the rainbow."
conditions="A 1.00 carat diamond can range in price from about $1,000 to over $12,000."
